Description

few strokes as possible.

vGolf includes 4 playable 18 hole courses, 1 game mode for up to 4 players,
full voice commentary, and several characters to choose from.

Full statistics tracking for each player profile allows you to compete against
yourself and your friends locally.

Support for additional courses, avatars, and commentaries is built in so you
can add new content to the game. Use the included design tools to create your
own content. Submit your creations (see Upload Instructions) and have them
