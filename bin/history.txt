Fixed results screen.

Update Galaxy Grounds course with more realistic pars.


1.23:

Add additional control options for OpenPandora users. The directional keys can
now be used to line up your shot and the action buttons can be used to putt and
toggle the HUD.

Hide game cursor on OS X since the OS cursor is always displayed there.

Allow curl to timeout when attempting to upload or download leaderboard data.

1.22:

Fixed collision detection bug which caused false collisions under certain
circumstances.

Fixed issue where Backspace couldn't be used to erase characters when entering
text.


1.2:

them by opening them in the editor, selecting "Set Par" on any hole, and saving
them.

Course editor now displays the dimensions of the current image on the status bar
in Images mode.

loading routine attempts to filter out incorrectly saved data. If the stats for
your profile appear incorrect after loading in this version you will need to
delete your profile and create a new one.
