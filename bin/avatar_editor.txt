Editing

To select a drawing tool, click the buttons on the top toolbar. Drawing tools are as follows:

  Paint:            Draw one pixel at a time.
	
  Line:             Draw a line from one point
                    to another.
	
  Flood Fill:       Fill an area.
	
  Rectangle:        Draw an outline rectangle.
	
  Filled Rectangle: Draw a filled rectangle.
	
  Clear:            Completely clear the
                    image.
	
  Circle:           Draw an outline circle.
	
  Filled Circle:    Draw a filled circle.
	
  Select:           Select a part of the
                    image.

To select a color, left- or right-click the color you want from the palette on the right. You can also select a color from the image editing area by holding Control and clicking on the desired color.

To draw, left- or right-click in the drawing area. This will use the currently selected drawing tool and the color assigned to the mouse button you pressed to draw on the current image.

To select a different "pose," click the pictures on the bottom. vGolf avatars have four different poses which are displayed depending on what is happening in the game.
